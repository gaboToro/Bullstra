# Logistics and Supply Chain Management System

This project implements a modern and scalable solution to manage complex logistics processes, using a microservices architecture, event-based communication, and next-generation technologies.

## Goal
Optimize supply chain operation by automating key processes: inventory management, orders, shipping, suppliers, users and predictive analysis.

## Main technologies

- **Event-driven architecture** with Apache Kafka/RabbitMQ
- **30+ microservices** distributed by business domains
- **Multilanguage backend:** Java (Spring Boot), Python (FastAPI), Node.js, Go, C#
- **Cross-platform frontend:** React (Web), React Native/Flutter (Movil), Electron (Desktop)
- **Hybrid databases:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Elasticsearch, InfluxDB, Neo4j
- **CI/CD** with GitHub Actions y Docker
- **Infrastructure as code** Terraform
- **Observability and monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK, Jaeger

## Main modules

- Inventory and Warehouses
- Orders and Billing
- Shipments, Routes and Tracking
- Supplier and Purchasing Management
- Users, Roles and Authentication
- Data analytics and reports.

## Featured Architecture

- N-Layers and SOLID principles in each service
- Asynchronous communication between services (EDA)
- API Gateway, Circuit Breaker and Service Discovery
- Distributed tracing and real-time metrics

## Security

- JWT for authentication and authorization
- CORS and HTTPS
- Access controlled by environment (QA and Production)

## Academic and professional use
This system was designed as part of an advanced distributed programming project, and can be adapted or extended for real environments in logistics, e-commerce or distribution companies.
